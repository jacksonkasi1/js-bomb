#  Critical Mass Simulation

## Overview
This project is a hypothetical JavaScript simulation that demonstrates the concept of critical mass in a nuclear physics context. It is designed for educational purposes only and showcases how JavaScript can be used to model complex scientific concepts. The code simulates gathering materials, ensuring safety protocols, calculating critical mass, and simulating a reaction initiation process.

## Installation
To run this simulation, clone the repository and install Node.js. No external libraries are required for this simulation.

```
git clone https://github.com/jacksonkasi1/js-bomb
cd js-bomb
node index.js
```

## Usage
This script is run in a Node.js environment. Execute the script with the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Code Explanation

### Step 1: Gather the Necessary Chemicals and Electrical Tools
At this stage, the simulation sets up the required elements and tools which are stored in arrays. These represent the hypothetical inputs for the simulation.

### Step 2: Set Up a Safe Work Environment
Safety is paramount in any scientific experiment. This function checks a series of safety protocols to ensure a safe simulation environment.

```javascript
function setupSafety() {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 3: Simulate the Critical Mass Calculation
This function calculates whether a given mass of uranium-235 has reached the critical mass required for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.

```javascript
function calculateCriticalMass(uraniumMass) {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 4: Assemble the Subcritical Masses
The simulation then hypothetically assembles subcritical masses using the provided materials.

```javascript
function assembleBomb(subcriticalMasses, tools) {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 5: Implement a Safety Check
A safety check is simulated to ensure the assembled masses have not inadvertently reached a critical state.

```javascript
function safetyCheck(bombAssembly) {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 6: Control the Movement of the Movable Cylinder
This simulates the mechanical action that would hypothetically bring subcritical masses together.

```javascript
function moveCylinder() {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 7: Simulate the Reaction Initiation Process
This function represents the final step where the simulation checks if the hypothetical conditions for a reaction have been met.

```javascript
function initiateReaction() {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 8: Test the Bomb Assembly Simulation
The entire simulation is tested with this function, running through all steps to simulate a full assembly process.

```javascript
function testBombAssembly() {
  // Code...
}
```

### Step 9: Run the Test
Finally, the test is executed to see the simulation in action.

```javascript
testBombAssembly();
```
